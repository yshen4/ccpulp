# Introduction

This repository is to show how to use dynamic programming (DP) to solve real world probelms.

# Why to use DP?
Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and a computer programming method. 

The method simplifies a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner. While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, in computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have optimal substructure.

If sub-problems can be nested recursively inside larger problems, so that dynamic programming methods are applicable, then there is a relation between the value of the larger problem and the values of the sub-problems.In the optimization, it is called the Bellman equation.
